Read along below for some ways you can add friends, party up, and even make new ones!<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"How To Play Fortnite With Friends\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/how-to-play-fortnite-with-friends-1920x1080-606687204.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<h2><br />\n1. Playing Fortnite on different&nbsp;platforms? No worries.</h2>\n\n<p>If your friends are playing Fortnite, you can easily play with them, regardless of platform. Fortnite offers crossplay so that you can get in the same party as your friends \u2014 whether they\u2019re playing on console, PC, Mac, or mobile. Send them a party invite and play in a match together!</p>\n\n<h2><br />\n2. Stick together with your Epic friends.</h2>\n\n<p>You can better know when your friends are playing Fortnite if you add them to your Epic friends list. \u201cEpic Friends\u201d are your friends across the entire Epic Games ecosystem, including games by Epic and the Epic Games Launcher. An Epic Friend is your friend across all platforms!<br />\n<br />\nIf your friend\u2019s console account is linked to their Epic account and if their settings allow, just go to the Add Friends tab then search their Epic display name. From there, send them an Epic Friend invite and keep the party going no matter how you play.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2><br />\n3. Squad up with ease.</h2>\n\n<p>When your Epic or console friends are playing Fortnite, you can invite them to your party simply by going to the in-game friends list, clicking their name, and selecting \u201cInvite to Party.\u201d A party <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/help/fortnite-c75/battle-royale-c93/how-do-i-manage-my-party-and-voice-chat-options-from-the-fortnite-lobby-a3477\">set to \u201cPublic\u201d or \u201cFriends Only\u201d</a> will appear in friends\u2019 Joinable Parties list with no invite needed!<br />\n<br />\nYou can even get the party started before you start playing. With Party Hub, a feature on the Fortnite mobile app, you can see which friends are online, start a party, and voice chat with that party before jumping in the game on any platform. Learn more in our <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/news/party-hub-faq\">Party Hub FAQ</a>.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\n4. Trying to find members for your squad?</h2>\n\n<p>In addition to your other social circles, each of our official Fortnite <a href=\"http://discord.gg/fortnite\" target=\"_blank\">Discord</a> servers \u2014 distinguished by language \u2014 is a great place to connect with other members of the Fortnite community. Be sure to check Discord\u2019s Terms of Service, and remember to always use respect when communicating online.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\n5. I\u2019m partied up. What\u2019s next?</h2>\n\n<p>Now that you\u2019re in a party, here\u2019s a party primer. The player who starts the party is the \u201cparty leader.\u201d The party leader can promote someone else to be the party leader by choosing their name in the \u201cParty Members\u201d list and selecting \u201cPromote.\u201d Besides \u201cPublic\u201d and \u201cFriends Only,\u201d party leaders can set their party to the invite-only \u201cPrivate.\u201d&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nA party can have up to 16 players, suitable for modes with Large Party Support like Creative mode and Team Rumble. If you wish, you can mute players in the party so that you do not hear them through voice chat. If you\u2019re the party leader, you can also remove players. <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/help/fortnite-c75/battle-royale-c93/how-do-i-manage-my-party-and-voice-chat-options-from-the-fortnite-lobby-a3477\">Learn more about managing your party and voice chat options</a>.</p>\n", "trendingImage": "https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/13br--friends-list-educational-newsheader2-1920x1080-612341199.jpg", "sticky": false, "short": "Read our five tips for how to play Fortnite with friends \u2014 even if they're on different platforms.
