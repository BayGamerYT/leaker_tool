Get up to 20% savings on V-Bucks and real-money offers for every purchase on PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, PC, and Mac, and on mobile when using select payment methods.<br />\n<br />\nThis isn\u2019t a sale\u2026 <strong>these are new discount prices available anytime!</strong> We\u2019re excited to pass along these savings to you and will continue to look for additional ways to bring value to all Fortnite players. Here\u2019s how to snag your savings.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nPC and Console Savings</h2>\n\n<p>Starting today, any V-Bucks or real-money offers you purchase on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PC, and Mac are now discounted by up to 20%. You don\u2019t need to do anything!</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nEpic direct payment on Mobile</h2>\n\n<p>Today, we\u2019re also introducing a new way to pay on iOS and Android: Epic direct payment. When you choose to use Epic direct payments, you save up to 20% as Epic passes along payment processing savings to you.<br />\n<br />\nGrab the latest Fortnite update to begin saving today! Here\u2019s how it works:</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Epic direct pay on Apple App Store\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/epic-direct-pay-apple-app-store-2045x979-730033169.png\" /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Epic direct pay on Google Play Store\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/epic-direct-pay-google-play-store-2045x979-730031947.png\" /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Choose Epic direct payment to get the best deal on V-Bucks and real-money purchases.</em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nCurrently, when using Apple and Google payment options, Apple and Google collect a 30% fee, and the up to 20% price drop does not apply. If Apple or Google lower their fees on payments in the future, Epic will pass along the savings to you.<br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\"><!--td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->\n</style>\n</p>\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" dir=\"ltr\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n\t<colgroup>\n\t\t<col width=\"100\" />\n\t\t<col width=\"171\" />\n\t\t<col width=\"134\" />\n\t\t<col width=\"117\" />\n\t</colgroup>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td colspan=\"4\" data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Epic Mega Drop Savings (1,000 V-Bucks)&quot;}\" rowspan=\"1\">Epic Mega Drop Savings (1,000 V-Bucks)</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\n\t\t\t<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot; \\nNew Discount Price&quot;}\">New Discount Price</td>\n\t\t\t<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Google Play&quot;}\">Google Play</td>\n\t\t\t<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;App Store&quot;}\">App Store</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;US Dollar&quot;}\">US Dollar</td>\n\t\t\t<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;$7.99 + Sales Tax&quot;}\">$7.99 + Sales Tax</td>\n\t\t\t<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;$9.99 + Sales Tax&quot;}\">$9.99 + Sales Tax</td>\n\t\t\t<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;$9.99 + Sales Tax&quot;}\">$9.99 + Sales Tax</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Euro&quot;}\">Euro</td>\n\t\t\t<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;7.99\u20ac VAT Inc.&quot;}\">7.99\u20ac VAT Inc.</td>\n\t\t\t<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;9.99\u20ac VAT&quot;}\">9.99\u20ac VAT</td>\n\t\t\t<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;9.99\u20ac VAT&quot;}\">9.99\u20ac VAT</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p><br />\nEpic direct payment is supporting many countries/regions&nbsp;and the list will grow.

No problem! You\u2019ll find that V-Bucks and real-money offers are now discounted by up to 20% through the Epic Games App at <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/mobile/android/get-started\" target=\"_blank\">epicgames.com</a>&nbsp;and the <a href=\"https://apps.samsung.com/appquery/appDetail.as?appId=com.epicgames.portal\" target=\"_blank\">Samsung Galaxy Store</a>.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>What does 20% off V-Bucks mean?</strong><br />\n<br />\nV-Bucks and real-money offers can now be purchased at new prices discounted up to 20% on console and PC/Mac. On mobile, you can select Epic direct payment to get your new discount (not yet available in all countries/regions - more countries/regions coming soon).<br />\n<br />\n<strong>What if I recently purchased V-Bucks?</strong><br />\n<br />\nPlayers that purchased V-Bucks or purchased a real-money offer like Summer Legends in the last 30 days (July 14, 2020 - August 13, 2020) will be granted a V-Bucks bonus by August 17! The V-Bucks bonus will be 20% of the total purchase amount during that time frame.<br />\n<br />\nTo celebrate the Fortnite Mega Drop, we\u2019re gifting all active players the Shooting Starstaff Pickaxe for FREE. Enjoy and thank you for being a part of the community!<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Shooting Starstaff Pickaxe\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-shooting-starstaff-pickaxe-1920x1080-730034937.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\n<strong>What does the Fortnite Mega Drop mean for Support-A-Creator payments?</strong><br />\n<br />\nPlayers can now purchase more V-Bucks for less, but your Support-A-Creator rates will remain the same. For every 2,000 V-Bucks spent, you\u2019ll still receive $1.00 USD.<br />\n<br />\nSo when players spend the same amount of money in Fortnite as they have previously, creators can now earn even more when those additional V-Bucks are spent!<br />\n<br />\n<strong>What if my currency is NOT supported with Epic direct payment?</strong><br />\n<br />\nAs we begin to support more currencies for Epic direct payment, we will update players.<br />\n<br />\n<strong data-stringify-type=\"bold\">Does Save the World receive Mega Drop savings?</strong><br />\n<br />\nYes. Mega Drop savings apply to Save the World.<br />\n<br />\n<strong data-stringify-type=\"bold\">Are you discounting the price of V-Bucks cards at physical stores&nbsp;too?</strong><br />\n<br />\nYes. We\u2019re issuing new V-Bucks cards to reflect the discount prices wherever they are sold. In the meantime, previously issued V-Bucks cards will receive a V-Bucks bonus of 20% upon redemption.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<strong>More questions?</strong><br />\n<br />\nGet more details in our <a href=\"http://Fortnite.com/news/announcing-epic-direct-payment-on-mobile\" target=\"_blank\">Epic Direct Payments Blog</a>, or check out our <a href=\"http://epicgames.com/site/fortnite-mega-drop-faq\" target=\"_blank\">Fortnite Mega Drop Press FAQ</a>.\n<style type=\"text/css\"><!--td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->\n</style>\n</p>\n",

         "content": "<p>\n<style type=\"text/css\"><!--td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->\n</style>\nToday, August 13, we\u2019re announcing a new way to pay on iOS and Google Play: Epic direct payment. This is the same payment system that we use to process transactions on PC, Mac and Android for Fortnite and the Epic Games Store. We\u2019ve been working hard to scale our eCommerce platform to support transactions for big events like Fortnite Season launches and the Epic Games Store Mega Sale, and we\u2019re excited to bring the same trusted payment system to iOS and Google Play. In this blog you\u2019ll find more behind-the-scenes details about our focus on security when it comes to transactions.<br />\n<br />\nHundreds of millions of players around the world have Epic accounts, and allowing all of our players to transact easily and securely is a top priority for Epic Games. Below are just a few ways we approach security with Epic direct payments to help keep your transactions safe.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nEpic direct payment security measures</h2>\n\n<h3><br />\nPCI-DSS Compliance:</h3>\n\n<p>The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) sets rigorous security requirements to prevent cardholder data loss as well as general requirements for the prevention, detection, and response to security incidents for all organizations accepting and/or processing payments. Epic Games\u2019 eCommerce system has been PCI-DSS compliant since 2017. We were recently audited by RSI Security for PCI-DSS compliance as a Level 1 merchant and passed with no nonconformities in July of this year.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\neCommerce Security:</h3>\n\n<p>Epic Games utilizes Amazon Web Services (AWS) to create and maintain a secure Cardholder Data Environment (CDE) segmented from our other business assets and users. All transaction data is transmitted through encrypted channels based on TLS v1.2. Access to the CDE is limited to users which have a business need to know and have undergone security awareness training, including secure coding principles such as the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) secure coding guidelines. Furthermore developers are trained to spot common vulnerabilities in code (OWASP Top Ten) and the associated prevention techniques. We never store your credit card number on our systems. Rather, your payment details are stored with the payment service provider such as PayPal and Chase Payments.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Security Assessments, Pentests and Vulnerability Scanning:</h3>\n\n<p>The Epic Games security teams perform internal and external assessments and penetration tests of our infrastructure. These tests leverage a mixture of weekly vulnerability scans and adversarial penetration tests. Any issues discovered are remediated with the appropriate teams and verified by the security team.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>HackerOne Bug Bounty Program:</h3>\n\n<p>In addition to our own internal security teams, Epic Games also has an active Bug Bounty program on HackerOne with over a hundred Security Researchers that test our systems for security bugs and vulnerabilities. Beyond our eCommerce systems, our Bug Bounty program also covers a wide range of Epic Games infrastructure. This list is constantly growing as our services continue to expand.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://Fortnite.com/news/the-fortnite-mega-drop-permanent-discounts-up-to-20-percent\" target=\"_blank\">Today we are taking another big step</a>, bringing the same Epic payment services which you are familiar with on PC to iOS and Google Play via Epic direct payments. If you already have a payment account saved with us on PC or Mac, the same account will be available on mobile for iOS and Android players using the App Store and Google Play. With our new mobile payments, we continue to hold ourselves to the highest eCommerce standards:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>We work with trusted industry leading payment partners (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.chase.com/digital/resources/privacy-security/security/how-we-protect-you\" target=\"_blank\">Chase</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/re/webapps/mpp/paypal-safety-and-security\" target=\"_blank\">PayPal</a>) to bring you safe and secure payment options.</li>\n\t<li>At peak, we process tens of thousands of transactions per minute across the globe.</li>\n\t<li>We will never sell, broker, or trade your information. We\u2019ll only use it to complete your requested transactions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We want you to feel safe in all things you do in the Epic Games ecosystem, and that's why we are continuing to work hard to bring this payment option to you wherever you play on mobile. See the <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/help/fortnite-c75/trending-topics-c140/where-is-epic-direct-pay-supported-for-ios-and-google-play-store-users-a6615\" target=\"_blank\">full list of territories we currently support with Epic direct payments</a>. We will continue to grow our services to reach more people to provide additional trusted payment options for our players.<br />\n<br />\nThank you for playing with us!</p>\n",
